\textbf{6.1 Words and morphemes}


Words are \textbf{free forms that have meaning}. There are three main reasons why they are considered free. Firstly, they can appear in \textbf{isolation}, meaning that in some contexts a single word can be a whole, perfectly grammatical utterance. Secondly, they are \textbf{moveable} – they can occupy different positions in a sentence. Lastly, they are \textbf{inseparable}, which means that no other pieces can be randomly put inside them. However, there are smaller forms than words that contain meaning – \textbf{morphemes}.


We distinguish two types of morphemes: \textbf{free morphemes} (they can stand on their own, which means that some words can also be morphemes) and \textbf{bound morphemes} (they have to be attached to something else, for instance units, such as \textit{-ed}, which carries the past tense meaning, and \textit{-s} or \textit{-es}, which indicate grammatical number). We can divide words into those that consist of only one morpheme, described as \textbf{morphologically simple}, or \textbf{monomorphemic} and words that have more than one attached morpheme, called \textbf{morphologically complex} or \textbf{polymorphemic} words. The latter are built of a \textbf{root} (a single morpheme that determines the core meaning of the word) and one or more \textbf{affixes} (bound morphemes that can be attached to the end of a root, called \textbf{suffixes}, or to the beginning of a word, called \textbf{prefixes}). In some other languages, for instance, Tagalog, there are also \textbf{infixes} – morphemes that are placed in the middle of a word.
