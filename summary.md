##5.3 [Adults Learning L2 Phonotactics](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/chapter/5-3-adults-learning-l2-phonotactics/)

Unfortunately, phonemic contrasts are not the only obstacle making second language acquisition challenging for an adult. There are also **phonetic inventory** and **phonotactic constraints** which are parts of the mental grammar. 

**Phonetic inventory** is the set of segments that are present in the grammar (number of consonants and vowels). For instance, English language has 25 consonants, and 14 vowels while in contrast, language spoken in Hawaiian islands has only 8 consonants and 5 vowels. There are languages that have these numbers hightened as well. 

**Phonotactic constraints** are mental grammar restrictions on which sounds can appear in which positions and what syllable structures can be used. 

All the needed adaptations are a part of learning an L2, and they come from already established grammatical structures and constraints of our L1.  

##5.4 [Attitudes about Accents](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/chapter/5-3-attitudes-about-accents/)

Everyone has an accent. But *why* L2 speakers have an accent when speaking L1 language? The accent of L2 speaker is heavily influenced by their mental grammar and restrictions of their L1 language. 

Linguistics does not rate or rank languages or accents - but some people from L2 countries speaking L1 language could have experienced **stigma**. If an accent is stigmatized, that means people's attitudes are automatically negative, and could have some sort of expectations about that accent. In places where English is widely spoken, those who aren't native speakers or who learned English as adults are frequently stigmatized.

The longer we listen to someone, the more we grasp what they're saying: this is known as **perceptual adaptation**, meaning that the more familiarity we have with their voice or accent, the better we will understand what they are saying. Also listening to wide array of accents makes us more prone to understanding a person with completely new accent right away.

**6.1 Words and morphemes**

Words are **free forms that have meaning**. There are three main reasons why they are considered free. Firstly, they can appear in **isolation**, meaning that in some contexts a single word can be a whole, perfectly grammatical utterance. Secondly, they are **moveable** – they can occupy different positions in a sentence. Lastly, they are **inseparable**, which means that no other pieces can be randomly put inside them. However, there are smaller forms than words that contain meaning – **morphemes**.

We distinguish two types of morphemes: **free morphemes** (they can stand on their own, which means that some words can also be morphemes) and **bound morphemes** (they have to be attached to something else, for instance units, such as _-ed_, which carries the past tense meaning, and _-s_ or _-es_, which indicate grammatical number). We can divide words into those that consist of only one morpheme, described as **morphologically simple**, or **monomorphemic** and words that have more than one attached morpheme, called **morphologically complex** or **polymorphemic** words. The latter are built of a **root** (a single morpheme that determines the core meaning of the word) and one or more **affixes** (bound morphemes that can be attached to the end of a root, called **suffixes**, or to the beginning of a word, called **prefixes**). In some other languages, for instance, Tagalog, there are also **infixes** – morphemes that are placed in the middle of a word.

**6.2 Allomorphs**

One morpheme might have more than one **allomorph**. It simply means that depending on the surrounding environment morpheme can have different but related forms that still have the same meaning. For instance, _a_ means “one of something, but not any particular one” and it appears before words that start with consonants, but changes to _an_ when it stands before words that begin with vowels. Another example is an English plural morpheme. It can be represented as _-s_, in words like _books_ or _apples_, but as _-es_ in words like _bushes_ or _churches_, however, in each of these examples it carries the same meaning of “more than one”.

**6.3 Inflectional Morphology**

**Inflectional morphology** conveys grammatical information, such as number, tense, agreement or case, therefore, the role of **inflectional morphemes** is to add this information to a word.

The first example of inflectional morphology is a **number** on a noun. In English, the plural number is represented by either _-s_ or _-es_, but there are also irregular plural morphemes. Other languages, such as Manam, have a morpheme for the dual number, which indicates exactly two of something. Another example of inflectional morphology is a **tense** on a verb. In English, tense inflection is indicated by morpheme _-ed_ or a change in the vowel of the verb. **Agreement** on verbs is another kind of inflectional morphology. It occurs in languages, such as French, Spanish or Italian, in which the suffix at the end of a verb changes depending on who the subject of the verb is. For instance, _je chante_ (ang. _I sing_) and _tu chantes_ (ang. _you sing_). There is also **case** inflection, meaning that the morphology on a noun changes depending on the noun’s role in a sentence. For example, in German sentences _Der Junge sieht Sofia_ (ang. _The boy sees Sofia_) and _Sofia sieht den Jungen_ (ang. _Sofia sees the boy_) the word _Junge_ has different morphemes to indicate its different roles – in the first sentence it is a subject and in the second it is an object.

**6.4 Derivational Morphology**

In the process of **derivation** new words are created by means of adding an affix to a **base**. The meaning of the newly created word is slightly changed despite still being related to the original form. For instance, the addition of the suffix _-er_ to the verb _write_ creates a new word which describes the doer of the action. Drawing on this example, it can be noted that **derivation** often changes the lexical category of the word.

Another important feature of derivation is that it can be performed on a word that has been previously derived itself. In other words, the word _computerize_ is created by adding the suffix _-ize_ to the base _computer_, which has been formed by adding _-er_ to the base _compute_.

**6.5 Inflectional Morphology in Some Indigenous Langauges**

The morphology of many of the **Indigenous Languages** seems to be richer than that of English. For instance, **Inuktitut**, spoken by 40 000 people in the Artic region, uses suffixes to indicate **dual** number of objects being refered to. This can be exemplified in the word _matuuk_ (two doors), which is created by the addition of _-uk_ to the **base** _matu_ (a door). This can also be noticed in the morphology of verbs.

In the case of **Cree languages** words are categorized by **animacy**. It refers to an arbitrary distinction betwwen animate and inanimate objects.

Attention is also paid to the use of **pronouns** - namely, the division into inclusive we ("all of us") and exclusive we ("we but not you"). Moreover, **Cree languages** indicate **proximate** and **obviative** third person, which mark the proximity of the speaker to the object they refer to - both in space and time.

**6.6 Creating new words**

There is a multitude of ways for new words to enter a language. For example, creating a new form, which does not derive from an exisiting form, is called **coining**. Another way for a word to be introduced is to borrow it from another language. However, it is affixation that is considered to be the most **productive** way to create new words. This is followed by **compounding**, which involves merging two free morphemes into a single form. It is also common for existing words to change their meaning thus creating a new item. For instance, _ghost_ can refer to a paranormal object, but also to the action of ignoring someone on social media. Creating **acronyms** and **clipping** are yet another examples of creating new words from alreading existing forms. Lastly, new words can be created by means of **blending**. In the process two lexical items are combined with their bordering parts overlapping. All these processes demonstrate the **generativity** of grammar.
